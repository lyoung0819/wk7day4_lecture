# An infinite number of shelves are arranged one above the other in a staggered fashion.
# The cat can jump either one or three shelves at a time: from shelf i to shelf i+1 or i+3 (the cat cannot climb on the shelf directly above its head), according to the illustration:

# Input
# Start and finish shelf numbers (always positive integers, finish no smaller than start)

# Task
# Find the minimum number of jumps to go from start to finish

# Example
# Start 1, finish 5, then answer is 2 (1 => 4 => 5 or 1 => 2 => 5)

# input - start, end
# subtract start from end to see how many more shelves in total
# modulo / fl div? divid by 3 to see how many 3s cat can jump
# look at left over (should be less than 3) and then add that to jump count


def solution(start, stop):
    to_go = stop - start
    return to_go%3 + to_go//3
